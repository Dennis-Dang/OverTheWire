# Bandit: Level 0 -> 1
<< [Level 0](https://github.com/Dennis-Dang/OverTheWire/blob/main/3_krypton/level_0.md) | [Level 1 -> 2](https://github.com/Dennis-Dang/OverTheWire/blob/main/3_krypton/level_01-02.md) >>

When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text.

## Solution:
